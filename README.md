# account-nuker
Nukes cloud accounts on a schedule

## aws-nuke

Based on [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke). Nukes the lab account every sunday at 23:00 PM.

## To Do

I can imagine some improvements:
- [ ] Skip nuke if a message on slack/telegram or co has been received
- [ ] Push message if nuke failed
- [ ] Add more clouds (e.g azure-nuke or others)
